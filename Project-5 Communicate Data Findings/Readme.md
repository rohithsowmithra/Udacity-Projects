## Dataset

Chosen dataset for this project is Ford GoBike System Data. This dataset consists of information of approximately 1,86M bike rides for FY2018. Features in this dataset are bike trip duration, start & end times, start & end location, user types, user date of birth etc. We use the existing features to support our analysis and also create new features to help in advancing our analysis.


## Key Findings

Exploration of this dataset have shown some interesting findings which include: subscribers use the system for commuting and they majorly follow commute timings. On the other hand, customers are of both kinds, i.e who use for commuting purpose and others for joy rides. Our visuals reveal that most of the customers would love to ride during the weekends throughout the day. Also, there are more male users who use the system than female and other genders, but female users usually take longer ride duration than male and other genders. Male users only prefer quick short rides. Average duration of most of the rides was found to be close to 10 minutes. One other interesting observation is that customers would love to ride during summers and would least prefer the rides during winters.
